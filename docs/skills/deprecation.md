# Developer Notification

## What’s changing with Cortana skills kit for Consumer?

We will be retiring the Cortana skills kit for Consumer (the developer platform) as well as the skills built on this platform. 

This change is part of our goal to transform the modern productivity experiences by embedding Cortana deeply into Microsoft 365 to help you stay connected and productive, efficiently and securely.  As we continue on this journey, we’re making changes to some Cortana capabilities that are more consumer centric, to enable us to focus on delivering these innovative, productivity-focused assistant experiences. 

## How does this change affect me?
1. The bot or bot service will not be impacted by this change and will continue to be available, except for the Cortana channel changes that are outlined below.
2. If you are an existing developer with a Cortana skill deployed to “self,” “test,” or “world,” the Cortana channel configuration page will remain available for a 30-day period, beginning August 6, 2020. During this period, if you submit your skill for certification and it passes the guidelines, it will be made available. 
3. On September 7, 2020, Cortana will be removed from the Channels page as an available channel for third-party developers. 
4. On September 7, 2020, all Cortana third-party consumer skills built with the Cortana skills kit will be retired.   
 
If you have any questions, please email [skillpub@microsoft.com](mailto:skillpub@microsoft.com).

## How do I build Cortana skills in the future?
[**Cortana skills kit for Enterprise**](../enterprise/overview.md) will continue to be available for TAP customers to build skills for their organization.
